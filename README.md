# code-emailer
Write a python program to: Collect all your programming assignments, summarize all the programming assignments and email all the programming assignments.

*For each subdirectory, generate a list of all identifiers used in the program (class, function, etc names) 
and place the [program, symbol] pairs in a <<<<<“symbols” file>>>>> (omitting duplicates). 
It is NOT necessary to specially filter keywords or built-in functions.

*Create a valid HTML web page in the main csc344 directory with links to each of the source code files 
AND the <<symbols file>>

*Create a zip file containing all the assignment sources, 
but excluding non-sources (executables, .class files, etc).
Also included should be the symbols file and the web page. 
Be sure the links in the webpage work after extracted.

*Prompt the user for an email address and send the zip file.
